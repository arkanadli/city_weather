# city_weather
 
City Weather Application using public API, build with Clean Architecture (Presentation,Domain,Data) and Test-Driven Development.
In addition to implementing the clean architecture, to optimize the development process in terms of producing minimal bugs and reducing repetitive debugging and fixing processes, we must undergo a testing process.
Test-Driven Development is an application development process where testing is the main character that drives the development. Testing code scenarios writed first before creating a feature in the application.
